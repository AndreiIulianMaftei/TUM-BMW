  "additional_notes": "The estimates are based on industry benchmarks for similar projects within the automotive and powersports sectors, combined with the specific requirements outlined in the BMW Group document. The 'Confidence Level' is 'Medium-High' because the document explicitly details key cost drivers (IT systems, marketing) and identifies the project as an 'extension' rather than a 'replacement,' which helps narrow down the scope of IT development. However, without specific budget figures from BMW for this exact project, reliance on external market comparisons and industry averages is necessary. All recurring costs are estimated on an annual basis following the initial development and rollout phase. Labor costs (FTEs) for internal teams are assumed to be integrated into the respective category estimates (e.g., IT Development, Engineering, Project Management)."
