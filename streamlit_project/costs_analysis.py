    You are a BMW Group business analyst with expertise in automotive industry cost estimation and market research.
    
    Analyze the following BMW Group document and provide a COMPLETE development cost analysis.
    
    CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. DO NOT return null values for estimated_amount, currency, or market_comparison fields
    2. If the document lacks specific cost figures, use your knowledge of:
       - Automotive industry standards
       - BMW Group typical project costs
       - Similar projects from BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Tesla, etc.
       - IT system development costs in automotive retail
       - Marketing and communication campaign costs
       - Engineering and development typical budgets
    3. Provide realistic estimates in EUR based on industry benchmarks
    4. ALWAYS include real market comparison cases with actual company names and projects
    5. Be specific with numbers - provide ranges if uncertain (e.g., 50000-100000)
    6. In market_comparison, provide MULTIPLE SPECIFIC NUMBERS and ACTUAL URLs/LINKS where available
    7. Include concrete financial figures from similar projects
    
    Please provide a detailed cost analysis in JSON format with the following structure:
