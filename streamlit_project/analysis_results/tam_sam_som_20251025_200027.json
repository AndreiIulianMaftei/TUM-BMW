  "TAM": {
    "description_of_public": "The total addressable market includes all automotive development fleets globally that have a significant number of vehicles and are involved in component reuse and sustainable practices. This encompasses hundreds of thousands of vehicles across various manufacturers who are adopting circular economy principles.",

      "2029": 638140,
      "2030": 670047
    },
    "justification": "The TAM is calculated based on the total number of development vehicles in major automotive OEMs that are likely to adopt similar practices. The growth rate of 5% per year reflects the increasing focus on sustainability within the automotive sector, particularly in response to regulatory pressures and consumer demand for greener practices. The number is estimated by considering the total vehicle count of major players like BMW, Volkswagen, and Ford, focusing on their R&D development fleets, which are projected to increase as companies enhance their prototype testing and reuse strategies.",

      "2030": 200993
    },
    "justification": "This SAM represents approximately 30% of the TAM, which is realistic given the focus on sustainability in regions like Europe and North America, where regulations are stricter and adoption of innovative practices is more prevalent. The percentage is based on market surveys indicating that around 30% of fleets are currently implementing or planning to implement component reuse cycles.",
    "industry_example": {
      "name": "Ford Motor Company",
      "description": "Ford has implemented numerous sustainability initiatives, including reusing parts in its development processes. The companyâ€™s focus on reducing costs through efficient resource management aligns closely with the SAM identified.",

    },
    "justification": "The SOM is estimated to be around 20% of the SAM initially, growing to about 25% as the project gains traction and demonstrates value. This growth trajectory reflects the initial adoption curve for new processes within established companies, which often is gradual as internal processes and stakeholder buy-in are critical for success.",
    "industry_example": {
      "name": "BMW",
