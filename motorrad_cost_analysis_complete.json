      "currency": "EUR",
      "reasoning": "This category covers the primary cost driver identified: technical capabilities for retailer IT systems (ordering, logistics, and pricing systems), as well as significant integration with BMW's NewBikeConfigurator (NBC) and backend systems for bundle creation and maintenance by headquarters (HQ) and National Sales Companies (NSC). Key components include: \n- Extensive adaptation of the NBC for dynamic display of bundles, application of discount logic, and real-time availability checks.\n- Development or significant extension of a Product Information Management (PIM) or Content Management System (CMS) module for robust bundle management (creation, editing, publishing, version control).\n- Major effort in integrating with dealer-facing systems, likely through an API layer that connects with various Dealer Management Systems (DMS) to enable single-click ordering, transparent pricing, and availability. This involves complex data synchronization and potentially updates to dealer portals.\n- Adaptation of BMW's internal logistics and inventory systems to provide accurate, real-time availability information for bundle components.\n- Implementation and testing of complex pricing logic to support bundle discounts and potentially integrate (ideally) labor costs for installation.",

      "reasoning": "This cost covers the intellectual and labor effort required to define, structure, and validate the accessory bundles. It includes:\n- Personnel costs for product managers, accessory specialists, and potentially engineering time to 'compile a catalog of criteria for accessory packages' and 'develop models with which the bundles can be combined'. This involves analyzing customer use cases, ensuring technical compatibility of combined parts, and defining pricing strategies.\n- Initial data population and content creation for the first set of bundles within the new systems.\n- Quality assurance and testing of bundle configurations to ensure all parts fit and function as intended.",

  "total_estimated_cost": 17000000,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "confidence_level": "Medium",
  "additional_notes": "The estimates are based on a typical 12-18 month project timeline for a comprehensive global rollout across major markets, assuming a hybrid development model utilizing both internal teams and external vendors/consultants. A key assumption is that existing core systems (e.g., NewBikeConfigurator, PIM, DMS gateway) are adaptable to integrate the new bundle logic without requiring a complete overhaul or major refactoring. The ambition to include 'labor costs' for pricing transparency is considered an 'ideal' outcome which might be implemented in a simplified form or as a subsequent phase, as full integration with complex workshop management systems would significantly increase IT costs beyond this estimate. Market comparison cases provide a realistic benchmark for the scale of investment in similar automotive digital initiatives at a leading OEM like BMW Group."
