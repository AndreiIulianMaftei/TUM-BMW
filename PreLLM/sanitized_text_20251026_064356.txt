PROJECT NAME: B2B Connect Motorcycle (formerly Port Partner)  
 
IDEA DESCRIPTION  
Briefly describe your idea to give a broad 
overview of the concept.  The project involves setting up a [sanitized] Motorrad certification and partner program to improve and monetize a range of third -party 
accessories for [sanitized] motorcycles. The aim is to achieve the widest possible range of products and compatibility of third -party 
accessories.  
Certified partners receive detailed information on mechanical, electrical, and/or electronic interfaces, a test catalog with product 
requirements, trademark rights in the form of a label for their products (e.g., “Made for [sanitized] Motorrad”), and, if applicabl e, (co -) 
marketing commitments with the necessary guidelines.  
Currently, it is not possible for third -party accessory manufacturers to access vehicle interface information (mechanical, E/E) via 
[sanitized]. The project is to be implemented through a multi -level and monetizable partner certification program (gold/silver/bronz e – 
analogous to the cost model), which will open up a new revenue stream and also complete and improve the customer experience i n 
the [sanitized] Motorrad ecosystem.  
 
Existing examples from other industries:  
• Apple : Apple's certification ecosystems (Made for iPhone; MFI (https://mfi.apple.com/) are considered the benchmark, 
containing specifications, certification tools, and a badge for tested accessories.  
• Amazon : “Works with Alexa” includes a certification badge and improved visibility in the electronic app store.  
• GoPro : “Works with GoPro”/“Designed for OpenGoPro” includes access to product and lifestyle images, promotion of 
integrations on the GoPro website, and creation of solution packages with GoPro cameras.  
• DJI : “DJI Recommended Accessories” for certified accessory solutions for use with DJI products.  
  
CUSTOMER SEGMENT  | PERSONA  
How would you describe the relevant 
customer segments that have just been 
selected ? • Third -party manufacturers:  These include established manufacturers of motorcycle accessories and new entrants to 
the motorcycle segment. They require information about [sanitized] vehicle characteristics (e.g., dimensions and mechanical, 
electrical, and/or electronic interfaces) in order t o ensure quality standards during the development and production of 
accessories. If there is already a connection to [sanitized], e.g., as a [sanitized] supplier, these manufacturers are often not 
associated with [sanitized] in the customer's perception.  
• End consumers:  [sanitized] Motorrad customers, motorcyclists. These customers require the following products:  
o Mass market:  Standard connectivity (communication systems, smartphone holders/integration, navigation 
devices, etc.), vehicle data/diagnostics/data connectivity, etc., if applicable), safety and emergency devices, 
connectivity hubs (theft, accident, etc.)  
o Niche market:  action cams/360 -degree cams, wearables, smart gear; off -road/race products  
• HO (retail organization):  interested in a high -quality, broad range of accessories.  
  
CUSTOMER PROBLEM(S)  
What is the customer problem for each of 
the customer segments that needs to be 
solved? Is there already a metric that proves 
the customer problem?  - Third -party manufacturers:  Currently have no way of developing or testing their products and functions with and on 
[sanitized] motorcycles in accordance with valid (interface) documentation. Manufacturers therefore use reverse engineering 
to access (mechanical & E/E) vehicle specifications , which means that compatibility and quality cannot be guaranteed, 
leading to functional and quality problems and, in some cases, customer frustration. customer frustration.  
- End customers:  Customers do not always find the right accessories in the [sanitized] Motorrad range, as not all accessories 
in demand, especially niche products, are offered by [sanitized] as original parts. Currently, end consumers cannot always rely 
on the quality and compatibility o f third -party suppliers.  
- [sanitized] Motorrad:  Competes with a large number of suppliers in the accessories market. These suppliers expand and/or 
offer alternatives to [sanitized] parts. In addition, incompatible accessories can lead to technical malfunctions, warranty 
claims, etc. on the motorcycle.   
  
VALUE PROPOSITION  
How does the idea solve the defined 
customer problem (Pain Relievers)? What 
benefits does the idea offer beyond mere 
problem -solving (Gain Creators)?  • Third -party manufacturers:  
o Access to information about [sanitized] vehicle characteristics:  For example, dimensions and mechanical, 
electrical, and/or electronic interfaces to ensure a standard of quality during the development and production of 
accessories.  
o Market access:  Certification opens up/simplifies access to [sanitized] Motorrad customers and dealers. Cooperation 
with [sanitized] Communications accelerates market launch and increases market acceptance.  
o Trust advantage:  The “Made for [sanitized] Motorrad” label signals quality and increases willingness to buy.  
o Innovation opportunities:  Partners can develop niche products that meaningfully expand the ecosystem.  
o Liability protection:  Certification reduces the risk of product liability and legal conflicts.  
o Cooperation:  Third -party providers benefit from close cooperation with [sanitized], dealers, and service networks.  
• End customers:  
o Increased customer satisfaction and loyalty:  
▪ Closing gaps in the product range and expanding the overall offering:  
▪ Safety:  Certified accessories minimize risks such as malfunctions and ensure a safe riding experience.  
o Accessory compatibility:  Accessories are technically tested and ideally function reliably without additional 
adjustments or specialist knowledge (depending on the product).  
o Value retention:  Motorcycles with certified accessories retain their market value for longer and are more 
attractive when resold.  
• [sanitized] -Motorcycles:  
o New revenue streams:  Licenses and expanded accessories open up additional sources of income. This allows 
participation in the value creation of third -party manufacturers.  
o Customer loyalty:  The ecosystem keeps end customers loyal to the brand and accessories in the long term.  
o Potential impact on the vehicle is reduced:  Damage/malfunctions to the motorcycle caused by incompatible 
accessories are avoided.  
o Brand strength:  “Made for [sanitized] Motorrad” becomes a quality feature that strengthens trust and premium 
positioning.  
o Innovation : Third -party providers bring new functions and creative enhancements to the existing system. [sanitized] 
can reduce the integration effort through standardized onboarding, testing, and labeling processes.  
o Securing the existing product range : e.g., in the case of the navigator, as this will be discontinued as a [sanitized] 
Original Accessory in the medium term.   
VALUE | FINANCIAL  
What are the most important cost drivers 
and revenue drivers in the business model 
(qualitative description)?  Costs:  
System enabling costs (setting up the partner management portal, process changes, product planning and development), legal 
consulting costs (one -time), marketing expenses per partner and product, ongoing partner management expenses (FTEs); 
Certification co sts (possibly covered by third -party providers); enabling for interface compatibility  
 
Revenue side:  
• Direct and predictable revenue:  
o License fees per product sold (royalties)  
o Revenue from subscriptions  
o One -time revenues (e.g., advertising costs but not certifications, if applicable)  
• Indirect revenues:  
• Through increased brand appeal, customer satisfaction, and thus long -term increased interest in the [sanitized] Motorrad 
product range, possibly in conjunction with existing [sanitized] accessories, such as holders for navigation systems  
  
VALUE | MARKET POTENTIAL  
What is the rough estimate of the market 
potential?  Disclaimer: The following figures are only a conservative initial analysis. A detailed analysis will follow in the validation phase.  
 
Direct and predictable revenues:  
• License fees per product sold (royalty):  
[Annual number of motorcycles sold¹] * [Number of product categories for accessories] * [Average take rate for 
accessories²] * [Average UPE for accessories in EUR ] * [Market coverage³] * [Royalty fee ⁴] 
 210,000¹ * 10 * 10% * EUR 350 * 50% * 10% = EUR 3,675,000 p.a.  
 
¹ Note regarding motorcycles sold : Value from 2024, worldwide sales.  
² Note regarding take rate: The take rate for [sanitized] accessories varies greatly, depending on the vehicle category. It ranges from 
approx. 1% for milled parts to 70% for cases. The assumed 10% take rate is therefore conservative.  
³ Note regarding market coverage: Approximately 50% of customers purchase their accessories from [sanitized].  
⁴ Note regarding royalty fee: Amazon charges a 30% sales commission, so the 10% is a conservative estimate -> to be 
validated.  
 
• Revenue from subscriptions:  
[Number of product categories for accessories] * [Average number of partners per product category] * [Average 
subscription fee¹]  
 TBD Potential assessment in the validation phase  
¹ Note regarding subscription fee: Apple charges $99/month  
  
 • One -time revenues  
[Number of product categories for accessories] * [Average number of partners per product category] * 
[Average number of products offered per category] * [Average listing costs/certification fee¹]  
 10* 5 (i.e., 50 partner agreements) * TBD * TBD = TBD Potential assessment in the validation phase  
 
¹ Note regarding certification fee : In order to integrate many providers into the portal, the certification process may only cover 
costs. No revenue potential through certification (to be validated).  
 
Indirect revenue:  Potential assessment in the validation phase →  e.g., additional upside for [sanitized] Motorrad volume

(online), marketing launch.  
  
RED FLAGS  
Does the idea raise any regulatory, criminal 
law, or ESG (Environment, Social, 
Governance) concerns?  Disclaimer : No direct red flags were identified, but there are potential issues that need to be examined during the validation phase.  
• Review of regulatory requirements:  Which issues are safety -related and to what extent are safety -related features 
associated with safety obligations?  
• Other technical and regulatory hurdles for accessories with electronics:  Is type approval required (liability issue if [sanitized] 
is certified)?  
• Data protection & cybersecurity : Is there liability in the event of malfunction in the case of connected add -ons (ISO/SAE 
21434, UN R155)? Also UN EXCE T156, Cyber Resilience Act, US Executive Orders, Tech De -Coupling, ...
