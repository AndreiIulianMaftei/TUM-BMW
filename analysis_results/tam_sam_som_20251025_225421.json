    "justification": "The TAM was calculated based on the estimated number of motorcycle owners in Europe and North America, which is approximately 50 million currently, growing at an annual rate of 5%. This assumption is supported by industry reports indicating a steady increase in motorcycle sales and ownership. The market for accessories is typically estimated to be 1.5 times larger than the market for motorcycles themselves, leading to a total addressable market of around $15 billion by 2030.",
