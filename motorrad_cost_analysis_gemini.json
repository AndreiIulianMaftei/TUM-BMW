This cost covers the labor involved in various project phases, including idea validation, identification of IT system adaptations, prioritization of changes, compilation of criteria catalogs, development of bundle models, and communication plan development, as outlined in the 'NEXT STEPS' section.

  "additional_notes": "The provided document is a high-level conceptual project description and does not contain any specific numerical financial figures for development costs. It identifies qualitative cost drivers but lacks quantitative estimates. Therefore, all estimated amounts are null, and a total estimated cost cannot be calculated. The 'TODO: Include your results here' for market potential further indicates the early, unquantified stage of this project idea. The document also mentions 'Additional costs for internal and external marketing of the bundles' as a 'recurring expense', which would be an operational cost following the development phase, rather than a one-time development cost itself."
