      "reasoning": "The document explicitly identifies 'technical capability for the retailer (retailer IT systems: ordering system, logistics system, and pricing system)' as the primary one-time cost driver. It also highlights the need for bundles to be 'displayed in the NBC (NewBikeConfigurator)', 'Dealers can order with a single click', and 'easy to see whether all parts are available'. This necessitates significant adaptations and integrations across BMW's global dealer network IT infrastructure, including the configurator, order management systems, inventory/logistics systems, and pricing engines. This involves backend development (APIs, data models), frontend UI/UX for dealer portals, and extensive testing across various system landscapes. While an 'extension', integrating new product types with complex pricing and availability logic into existing enterprise systems for a global operation is a multi-million Euro effort.",
