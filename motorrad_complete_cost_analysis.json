While specific figures are not in the document, ranges and averages from similar projects at BMW Group, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and other industry players have been used to derive realistic, market-comparable figures. Key assumptions include a global or significant regional rollout, necessitating robust IT infrastructure and extensive marketing. The 'one-time development' cost represents the initial investment for building and integrating the system. 'Annual' costs represent ongoing operational expenses post-launch.
